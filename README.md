A simple web application created to demonstrate the use of tailwind CSS

# Tailwind CSS
Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
A utility class is basically a class which does only one thing. Example: mb-5.

# Responsive Design using Tailwind CSS
Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it easy to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.
There are five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions:
sm -- 640px minimum-width.
md -- 768px minimum-width.
lg -- 1024px minimum-width.
xl -- 1280px minimum-width.
2xl-- 1536px minimum-width.
Breakpoints are designed to develop in a mobile first approach

# @apply Directive
Use @apply to inline any existing utility classes into your own custom CSS.

# Extending styles
Tailwind CSS provides options to extend the styles by adding custom utility classes.
It can be done by extending the theme in tailwind-config.js file
The theme section is where you define your color palette, fonts, type scale, border sizes, breakpoints â€” anything related to the visual design of your site.

# Pros of using Tailwind CSS
Save you design and development time.
Readable and meaningful utility class names.
Dark mode
Responsiveness
Purge CSS  to optimize the css file in production.
